<h1>16-665-226: A page about me.</h1>
<pre>
    It really is what the title suggests. It's simply a page about my person.
    What I do, what I work and where I live.
    The site is not complete and should serve as base for my or someone else's
    personal Website. Publicly show user input can only be made through the
    contact form. The inputs are not yet send to me via mail.
    Known bugs can be seen on Github.

<h2>Public sites: </h2>
<ul>
    <li>Home</li>
    <li>Passion</li>
    <li>Work</li>
</ul>
<h2>Non public sites:</h2>
<pre>
    Non public sites are not styled as I couldn't figure out how.
    These sites are not, and should not, be reachable by the menu.
    These are standard scaffold controller.

<ul>
    <li>/company</li>
    <li>/employment</li>
    <li>/person</li>
