# WebEngineering Module, Graded Exercise

## Commit Proposal

Matriculation Number: 16-665-226

My idea is to make a simple "About me" page where I am able to display some information about myself. 
Sites included by the Idea:
  - This is me. (Basic overview) Mostly static Page with non static(DB/Config) Contact formular & Address
  - My passion (A Page about my hobby as a glider pilot) Static 
  - My Work (Page abot what I do for a living)

On the My work page I would like to have a generated CV or Timeline. The Data should be stored other than HTML inside a SQL-DB or other persistance. 
I want to have fields vor ervery occupation like
  - From and To
  - Name of the Company
  - Company logo (If possible even dynamicly loaded)
  - Company homepage
  - List of work I did there
  
I would like to use https://html5up.net/solid-state and adapt it to my purpose and make it more flexible for this.
